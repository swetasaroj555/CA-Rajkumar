<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: large; ">Tax is an obligatory fee or other sort of levy that is levied by a government agency on a taxpayer (an individual or other legal entity) in order to pay for certain public expenses. Tax evasion, nonpayment, and resistance to taxation are all illegal and subject to punishment. Indirect taxes, such as the Goods and Services Tax or GST, and direct taxes, such as income tax, make up taxes. Therefore, it is crucial to follow tax regulations, make sure tax planning is done correctly, and file an income tax return. Strategies for tax planning are frequently used to assist businesses in achieving their financial and operational objectives. Both large and small businesses can benefit from tax planning, which is crucial for minimizing tax liabilities and ensuring that all applicable allowances, deductions, exclusions, and exemptions are combined 
    in the most tax-effective way possible to lower the overall tax payment.</p>

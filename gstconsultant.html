<h2>What is GST?</h2>
<p>Goods and Services Tax is the full name of the tax. It was initially mentioned in the February 28, 2006, Budget Speech. It established the groundwork for an extensive overhaul of India's indirect tax structure. Since its establishment, the indirect taxation system has undergone a series of revisions, culminating in its final implementation on July 1, 2017 as the Goods and Services Tax Act. 

</p>
<br>
<p>GST took the place of several indirect taxes that were imposed on various goods and services as a result of this tax reform. The regulatory agency overseeing all modifications and adjustments pertaining to this tax is the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC).
